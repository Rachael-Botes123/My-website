<h2>Nigeria's Origin</h2>
<p class="close-text">
    Nigeria's origin can be traced back to the ancient kingdoms and civilizations that existed in the region long before the modern nation was formed. Various ethnic groups, such as the Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Kanuri, and others, developed their own distinct cultures, societies, and kingdoms throughout history. Some of the most notable early kingdoms include the Nok culture (around 1000 BCE to 300 CE), which is known for its terracotta sculptures, and the great empires of Mali, Songhai, and the Hausa city-states in the northern region.
    The modern nation of Nigeria emerged through the process of colonization by the British in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1865, the British established a colony in Lagos, and in 1914, the British formally amalgamated the northern and southern protectorates and Lagos into one entity called the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Nigeria gained independence from the United Kingdom on October 1, 1960, marking the birth of the modern Nigerian state.
    The name "Nigeria" was coined by British journalist Flora Shaw in the late 19th century, derived from the Niger River, which flows through the country. The country’s rich history is shaped by its diverse ethnic groups, colonial experiences, and its quest for unity and development as a nation.
