        <h2>About Nigeria</h2>
        <p class="close-text">
            Nigeria is a vibrant and dynamic country, renowned for its resilience, diversity, and remarkable cultural contributions. As the most populous nation in Africa, it boasts over 250 ethnic groups, each with its unique traditions, languages, and customs. This cultural richness is reflected in the country’s music, art, and cuisine, with global recognition of Nigerian genres like Afrobeat, and its popular dishes, such as jollof rice and pounded yam.
            <br><br>
            Beyond its cultural wealth, Nigeria’s entrepreneurial population is one of its greatest assets. From technology to entertainment and business, Nigerians are at the forefront of innovation. Nollywood, Nigeria’s film industry, is the second-largest in the world, and Nigerian musicians and artists are making waves globally. Despite challenges like poverty and political instability, Nigerians are incredibly resilient, driven by a strong sense of community and national pride.

        <h2>Nigeria's Origin</h2>
        <p class="close-text">
            Nigeria's origins trace back to ancient kingdoms and civilizations, where ethnic groups like the Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and Kanuri thrived. The Nok culture, known for its terracotta sculptures, is one of the earliest examples of advanced civilizations in the region. Nigeria also played a role in the great empires of Mali, Songhai, and the Hausa city-states.
            <br><br>
            The modern nation of Nigeria emerged during British colonization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the formal amalgamation of northern and southern protectorates and Lagos in 1914. Nigeria gained independence from the UK on October 1, 1960, marking the birth of the modern Nigerian state. The name “Nigeria” was coined by British journalist Flora Shaw, derived from the Niger River.
